# 🌱 Plant Disease Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Plant Disease Classification system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The model takes a plant leaf image as input and predicts whether the plant is **healthy** or affected by a disease.

It supports **multiple crops and diseases**, making it useful for agricultural monitoring, early disease detection, and research purposes.

## 🧠 Model Details
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Input Image Size:** 224 × 224 (RGB)
- **Total Classes:** **38**
- **Output:** Predicted plant disease or healthy class

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained model is **hosted on Hugging Face** and loaded during runtime.

## 🗂️ Dataset Summary
- Leaf images from different crops
- Includes **healthy** and **diseased** plant samples
- Covers **38 distinct classes**
- Images are preprocessed and resized before training
